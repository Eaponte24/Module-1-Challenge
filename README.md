## Description

I was given a webpage and the coding behind the page and told to make sure the HTML and CSS was semantic and that links worked as well as other various issues. What you will see with what I have done is a cleaner CSS sheet along with changes made the the HTML to make it more semantic, the links at the top will now all bring you to where they are intended to and the images all now have ALT text tied to them. Throughout this project i learned how to properly tag elements together in CSS as well and debugging issues when it comes to linking to something within the same page. The outcome is a far cleaner CSS and a HTML that makes a bit more sense. 


## Usage

In the provided screenshots you will see the HTML and then the CSS as to how I consolidated the CSS so that all those Class/ids that had the same styling are now together on one line of CSS.
As well I will provide screenshots with how I changed the title of the webpage in the HTML and how its now seen in the tab bar as "Horiseon Home Page"

## Features

The main features to this project were, Making sure that all the links in the nav bar brought you to a specific place on the webpage and they now do. I cleaned up the HTML by added semantic tags such as nav and footer in there and removing the confusing names. As well as i added ALT text to all images in the HTML and added a title to the webpage so the tab now reads "Horiseon Home Page". Some of the CSS features that were worked on in this project is that you will see that before the code as class and ids that all had the same styling, i simply grouped those class and ids together so we could cut down on the lines in the CSS and make it easier to read. I added notes in the CSS to make it easier for the user to see what they will be making changes to if they choose to restyle the site in a later date. 

Here is a link to the project so you can test all the functions ive made changes to and see that they are working perfectly.
